      <h1>Tarn Adams</h1>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Tarn_Adams.jpg" alt="Tarn Adams" width="150" height="170"> 
      <p>Tarn Adams (born April 17, 1978) is an American computer game programmer, best known for his work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>. He has been working on the game since 2002 with his older brother Zach. He learned programming in his childhood, and has been designing computer games as a hobby. He quit his first year of a mathematics post doctorate at Texas A&M to focus on game development in 2006.</p>
      <p>Tarn was born in Silverdale, Washington, US, in 1978. His father, Dan, worked at a waste water treatment plant and used to manage data. He credited his father for teaching him to code and his closeness to his brother, Zach, to their family's constant shifting due to their father's work. Tarn and Zach grew up playing computer games and, with notebooks in hand, drawing their own renditions of the randomly generated creatures they encountered and logging their journeys in detail. In fifth grade, Tarn wrote his first animation game with Zach. Explaining his reluctance to socialize,[1] he said, "I was a get-home-from-school, get-on-the-computer kind of kid." Tarn stated that the main reason they started writing games was to be able to play them themselves, and complicated and unpredictable behavior guaranteed replayability.[2]</p>
